Ricoh R5U870 Linux Driver
Version 0.11.1, 2008/06/15

Requirements
============

To build/install this driver, you must have a set of configuration and
interface headers, or the complete build directory, for your running kernel,
or the target kernel for which the driver is to be built.  This should
include most files in the include/linux directory, and specifically
include/linux/autoconf.h and include/linux/version.h.

The required interface headers are usually located at or symlinked from:
/lib/modules/<version>/build

Your kernel must be 2.6.17 or newer.


Supported Hardware
==================

This driver supports the following OEM webcams:

05ca:1810 HP Pavilion Webcam - UVC
05ca:1830 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC2 (for VAIO SZ)
05ca:1832 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC3 (for VAIO UX)
05ca:1833 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC2 (for VAIO AR1)
05ca:1834 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC2 (for VAIO AR2)
05ca:1835 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC5 (for VAIO SZ)
05ca:1836 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC4 (for VAIO FE)
05ca:1837 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC4 (for VAIO FZ)
05ca:1839 Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC6 (for VAIO CR)
05ca:183a Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC7 (for VAIO SZ)
05ca:183b Sony Visual Communication Camera VGP-VCC8 (for VAIO FZ)
05ca:1870 HP Pavilion Webcam / HP Webcam 1000


Installation Process
====================

To attempt to build against the running kernel:

make

To build against a specific kernel:

make KDIR=/path/to/kernel

To install the modules to the appropriate location:

make install

-or-

make install KDIR=/path/to/kernel

Installed modules will be automatically probed for supported devices by the
udev coldplug component at boot, and the driver should be automatically
loaded on subsequent reboots.

NOTE: Previous releases of this driver have produced modules named
ry5u870.ko.  With the current release, the module name was changed to
r5u870.ko.  Ensure that any old versions are deleted after installing a
new version.


Loading the Driver
==================

If you installed the driver, you can just run:

modprobe r5u870

If you wish to load the driver without installing it, you must load the
prerequisite modules:

modprobe videodev
modprobe video-buf
modprobe v4l1-compat
modprobe v4l2-common
modprobe compat_ioctl32		(on 64-bit platforms)

You must also copy the microcode files (r5u870_*.fw) to /lib/firmware.

Then you may load the module manually:

insmod r5u870.ko

Debugging
=========

If you would like to enable debugging, please uncomment the line found
in debug.mk, and recompile.

Driver Options
==============

Below is a list of module parameters that may be used with the r5u870 module:

dv1000 -- HP Webcam handling mode
	HP has done it again and used ID 05ca:1870 for two distinct pieces
	of hardware: the HP Webcam 1000, found in HP Pavilion dv1000 series
	machines, and the HP Pavilion Webcam, found in other HP Pavilion
	machines that don't have Microdia cameras, and don't have the 
	05ca:1810 Ricoh UVC camera -- which is not actually any different 
	from the 05ca:1870 HP Pavilion webcam.  These two devices have
	different image sensors and require different microcode.
	0: Assume HP Pavilion Webcam
	1: Assume HP Webcam 1000
	2: Check DMI product name field (DEFAULT)

video_nr -- list of favored minor numbers
	A list of video capture minor numbers (/dev/videoX) to try to
	associate devices with, in order, before resorting to the first
	available minor number.

fixed_fbsize -- integer
	Sets the size in bytes of fixed-length frame buffers.  The default
	value is 1MB.  This is a compatibilty feature for buggy programs
	that use the V4L1 VIDIOCGMBUF call to allocate a frame buffer
	based on the current capture size, choose a larger capture size,
	and then attempt to capture frames.


Changes from original version (0.10.0)
======================================

 *  Properly implements V4L1 query ioctl functions. While version 1 has been
    obsoleted, it is still necessary to support it as a number of applications
    still use it, including GStreamer's v4lsrc element.
 *  Support for VGP-VCC7, VGP-VCC4, VGP-VCC6, and VGP-VCC8, including supplied
    microcode, as well as other cameras.
 *  Can compile against Linux kernels 2.6.24 or later.
 *  Uses a module approach to usbcam, and only require minidrivers to link
    against a header file. This code was posted in an email to LKML by Chris
    on May 1, 2007.

Bugs
====

Use the bug tracker at http://bugs.mediati.org/r5u870/.
If you get a 404, make sure there's a forward slash on the end. :)

Remember to submit in your bug report:
  * Version of the driver
  * Kernel version (uname -a)
  * Distribution name & version
  * lsusb output
  * lsmod output
  * dmesg output after loading r5u870 with debug=1
  * if you're getting distorted images, a sample of the camera output

Also remember to check if your bug has already been fixed!

Kopete 0.12 and earlier can be used with this driver, but colors may appear
distorted.  This is a problem with Kopete's YUV decoder, and should be fixed
in a future version.  Kopete may also set the gamma picture control to 0
for no apparent reason, causing the image to appear too dark to Kopete and
to other applications that subsequently open the camera.
